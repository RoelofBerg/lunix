Copy the script 'setup.sh' of the USB stick's TRANSFER folder to the home folder (~).
Leave internet connection active during the whole time.

Doubleclick the script "setup.sh", edit the pc name in line 19.
Save changes

Open a shell (start menu "CMD")

Execute:
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh


# 2x Updates o.Ä. müssen mit "Y" bestätigt werden


After a few minutes you see "YOU CAN REMOVE THE USB STICK NOW". Then you can remove
the USB stick and continue on another PC.

Press return to continue after the USB stick has been removed.

After about 15 minutes you'll be asked for licence agreements. Scroll down, press 'Y' and
wait a few hours for the process to complete.

When the process completed you see something like "x preocesses successfully executed, y processes didn't need to rerun". If (and only if) an error message appears instead, you can re-try the compilation procedure (again, leave internet active) with the following script

chmod +x nachbrenner.sh 
./nachbrenner.sh 

Ok, very good, now to the next PC :)
